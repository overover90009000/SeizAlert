# SeizAlert

An android application designed to help people who suffer from seizures.

### How it Works
* The application utilizes an accelerometer to detect when a person is experiencing a seizure. 
* Once enough shaking is detected an alarm is played as a safety precaution to ensure that the shaking was not a false alarm.
* If the alarm is not turned off in time, the application texts that the user is experiencing a seziure to a designated number.
  * The number is determined by the user before they launch the application.
